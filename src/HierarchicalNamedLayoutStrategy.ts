// This strategy gives us a file tree that mirrors that of notion.
// Each level in the outline becomes a directory, and each file bears the name of the Notion document.
// Pros: Easy to read and understand. The URLs are perhaps better for SEO.
// Cons: The URLs become fragile. Moving a file, enclosing it in a new level, or tweaking
// the title means the url will change. This may or may not be worth it to you.
//
// Note that I tried getting a readable file tree while generating slugs based on the notion page id.
// However Docusaurus still makes the url be the "hierarchical path"/slug. So the using the slug as an id
// doesn't buy us much... it would give protection against name changes, but not changes to the outline structure.
